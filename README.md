# Anki Flashcard Builder
In the past one year, I kept making Anki flashcards manually as I am really enjoying making cards during the English learning journey. As the number of cards became significanly large, I realize that it is the time to turn this traditional way automated.

## Retrieve Word Infomation
AwesomeTTS is good, but what if I want to bulk import audio files for a huge number of cards? This script downloads audio files for cards with audio file link from Cambridge, VocalWare, then assign to cards through AnkiConnect API automatically.

## Flexibility
You can choose what information to be filled into the fields you want.

## API
